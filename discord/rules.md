1. Read all the rules before participating in chat. Not reading the rules is not an excuse for breaking them.
* It's suggested that you read channel topics and pins before asking questions as well, as some questions may have already been answered in those.

2. Be nice to each other. It's fine to disagree, it's not fine to insult or attack other people.
* You may disagree with anyone or anything you like, but you should try to keep it to opinions, and not people. Avoid vitriol.
* Constant antagonistic behavior is considered uncivil and appropriate action will be taken.
* The use of derogatory slurs -- sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, or otherwise -- is unacceptable and may be grounds for an immediate ban.

3. If you have concerns about another user, please take up your concerns with a staff member (someone with the "mod" role in the sidebar) in private. Don't publicly call other users out.

4. From time to time, we may mention everyone in the server. We do this when we feel something important is going on that requires attention. Complaining about these pings may result in a ban.
* To disable notifications for these pings, suppress them in "Anime Game PS Dev basics → Notification Settings".

5. Don't ping members that arent part of a conversation, unless you know they are fine with it and can contribute.

6. Don't spam.
* For excessively long text, use a service like https://0bin.net/.

7. Don't brigade, raid, or otherwise attack other people or communities. Don't discuss participation in these attacks. This may warrant an immediate permanent ban.

8. Off-topic content goes to #off-topic. Keep low-quality content like memes out.

9. Trying to evade, look for loopholes, or stay borderline within the rules will be treated as breaking them.
​
10. Absolutely no talks about illegally obtained stuff. This includes:
* Server bins/ the "GIO" server and its resources.
* Beta downloads.
This is a zero-tolerance, non-negotiable policy that is enforced strictly and swiftly, up to and including instant bans without warning.

11. The first character of your server nickname should be alphanumeric if you wish to talk in chat.

12. Do not boost the server.
 Anime Game PS Dev Basics neither wants nor needs your server boosts, and your money is better off elsewhere. Consider the EFF (or a charity of your choice).
* Boosting the server is liable to get you kicked (to remove the nitro boost role), and/or warned. Roles you possessed prior to the kick may not be restored in a timely fashion.

13. No hornyposting (don't post things because they titillate you, or with intent to titillate or appeal to the prurient interest: when in doubt, keep any discussions of sex or sexuality clinical/academic).

14. Only post spoilers for the current and upcomming versions in spoilers and include some info about the type of spoiler (e.g. 4.1 Story spoiler). Older version spoilers can posted freely in development contextes when required.
